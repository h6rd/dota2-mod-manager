/* The documents, held to the repository they describe.
 *
 * `test/decisions.test.js` already pins the countable claims in DECISIONS.md. This is the wider
 * net, and it exists because of what a read-through on 2026-09-10 turned up: DECISIONS.md had an
 * entry headed "There is no linter and no formatter" three paragraphs above the entry explaining
 * why eslint had been added that morning, CONTRIBUTING.md said the same thing, ARCHITECTURE.md
 * put "every IPC handler" in main.js four days after they moved out of it, and the test-file
 * count was off by twenty.
 *
 * None of that needs a person to notice. A path that no longer exists, a script that was
 * renamed, a link to a deleted file and a claim the package contradicts are all machine-checkable,
 * so they are checked here rather than trusted to the next read-through.
 *
 * What is deliberately not here: prose. No test can tell whether "the interval is not lowered" is
 * still the decision, and pretending otherwise would be worse than leaving it to a human.
