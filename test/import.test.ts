/* Taking in a mod the user already has: a .vpk, a .zip, a folder, or bytes off a drop.
 *
 * This is the widest door in the app and the least fussy about what comes through it. A
 * Skinchanger pack unzips to a whole game tree with the archive several folders down. A
 * Dota2Changer mod arrives as an index plus data volumes, and the rest of the app assumes one
 * file per mod, so a half-folded set is exactly how a mod ends up half-loaded. An author's
 * working folder holds no archive at all. And whatever arrives, the language folder it lands in
 * belongs to the game and to other tools too, so what the app writes there has to be its own.
 *
 * Four hundred and fifty lines of src/installer.ts carry that, and until this file one method of
 * the fourteen had a test. Written before the section is split out, so the split has something to
 * prove itself against.
