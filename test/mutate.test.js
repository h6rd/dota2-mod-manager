/* The mutation harness in tools/mutate.mjs, and the mutants it is pointed at.
 *
 * A green suite says the tests ran, not that they would catch anything. The test asserting that a
 * rebuilt pack keeps its slot was green against code that allocated a new slot every time, and
 * only a deliberate breakage told them apart.
 *
 * Running the mutants takes a suite run each, so that is a command somebody runs (`npm run mutate`).
 * What runs on every push is the half that rots: whether each mutant still applies to the source it
 * names. Two of the first seven silently did not apply, which is the failure worth catching here -
 * a check that has stopped checking looks exactly like a check that passes.
