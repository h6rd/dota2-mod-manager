// config/app.json can turn a feature off after a release and put a notice in front of everyone
// who opens the app. It is fetched through the same public proxies as everything else, so it is
// signed, and src/remote-config.ts ignores a copy that does not verify.
//
// That makes an unsigned edit silent in the worst way: the file would go out, every client would
// quietly refuse it, and the switch nobody could see not working is the one you reached for in
// an emergency. Editing the file without re-signing has to fail here, loudly, before the commit
// is anywhere near a release.
//
// To re-sign after editing it:
//   CATALOG_KEY=<path to the private key> node tools/sign-catalog.js config/app.json
//
// The private key is not in this repository and must never be. It lives outside the working
// tree on the maintainer's machine.
