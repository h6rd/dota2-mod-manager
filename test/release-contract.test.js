/* The release, checked as a contract rather than remembered as a routine.
 *
 * A release here is five things that have to agree: the version in package.json, a section
 * under that number in the English changelog, the same section in the Russian one, the tag CI
 * builds from, and the notes CI lifts out of the changelog to put on the release page and into
 * the Discord post. Nothing enforced any of it.
 *
 * It has gone wrong twice. A `## 1.13.1` section was written for a fix that was never tagged
 * and had to be folded into the next version by hand. And `## 1.13.0` sat in the English
 * changelog complete while the Russian one was missing a feature and the whole Fixed block -
 * which nobody saw, because the only reader of the Russian file is a Russian user's "what's
 * new" popup.
 *
 * These run on every push. They cannot check that the words are good; they can check that a
 * version exists in both languages, that the two files agree about which versions exist, and
 * that CI will find something to publish.
