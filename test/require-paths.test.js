/* Every relative require resolves from the file that holds it.

 * src/ipc-library.js asked for './src/vpk' from inside src/. That resolves to src/src/vpk, which
 * is not there, and Node only says so when the line runs. Both lines sat inside a handler's
 * try/catch, so "adopt an external mod" and "adopt a cursor set" answered the window with
 * "Cannot find module" instead of adopting anything, for as long as they had existed.
 *
 * test/ipc-contract.test.js could not see it: it reads these files as text to check that channel
 * names line up, and never runs a handler body. Nothing else loaded those lines either, because a
 * require inside a function runs only when the function does. This test resolves every one of them
 * without running anything.
