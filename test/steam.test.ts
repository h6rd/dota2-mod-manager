/* Finding Dota, and deciding a folder really is Dota.
 *
 * validateGamePath is the gate: nothing is written into a folder that does not pass it, and a
 * false yes means the app starts putting VPK files somewhere that is not a game. It also has to
 * say yes to installs it has never seen - a library on a second drive, a Linux install, a game
 * folder whose executable was moved by an anti-cheat - so it accepts three different pieces of
 * evidence and only needs one.
 *
 * parseLibraryFolders reads a file Valve writes in a format Valve has changed more than once.
 * When it is wrong the app looks for the game on the wrong drive, which is hard to notice and
 * easy to pin down with a fixture.
 *
 * findDotaGamePath itself is not run here: it reads the registry and the real Steam of whoever
 * runs the tests, and a test that does that passes or fails depending on the machine.
 * gamelang.test.js had exactly that problem and had to be isolated after it broke on a
 * developer's own launch options. Everything behind it takes what it reads as arguments - what
 * `reg` printed, the home folder, the candidate roots, the libraries - and is tested below
 * against folders made here.
