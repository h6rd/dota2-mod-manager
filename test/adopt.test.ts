/* What a VPK goes through before it counts as a mod.
 *
 * This is the difference between a library row saying "pak42" and one saying "Pudge Hook", and
 * between a Skinchanger pack sitting as four heroes in one archive and four mods a user can
 * switch on separately. Every route in comes through here: the import button, drag and drop,
 * and the mods inside a shared preset - that last one used to land as a bare record, which is
 * why a received build showed up unnamed while the same file dragged in came out clean.
 *
 * The library is the real one in a temp folder. The installer and the schema service are fakes
 * that record what they were asked, because the question here is what gets decided about a
 * record, not whether a VPK parses: that is tested in test/vpk.test.ts and test/import.test.ts.
