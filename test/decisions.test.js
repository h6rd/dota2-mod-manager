// That file answers reviews with numbers - how long the main process's entry file is, how many
// test files there are, what the app depends on - and its whole argument is that a claim with a
// check next to it beats a claim without one. A document like that going stale is worse than not
// having written it: the next reviewer runs one command, finds it disagrees, and stops trusting
// the rest.
//
// So the countable claims are asserted here. Every failure message carries the current value, so
// fixing one is copying a number across rather than going to find it.
//
// Deliberately not asserted: the "last gone over" date and the version beside it. Those record
// when a person read the whole file, and a test that kept them current would be forging a review
// nobody did. Same for the prose - no test can tell whether "the interval is not lowered" is
// still the decision.
