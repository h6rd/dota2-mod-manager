/**
 * Type checking that is allowed to get better and not worse.
 *
 * `tsc --checkJs` reads the JSDoc this project already carries and says where the code and its own
 * documentation disagree. On the first run it found a require that had never resolved (two handlers
 * answered every call with "Cannot find module") and three pieces of JSDoc describing a different
 * function than the one below them. Those are fixed. What is left is sixty-odd places where a
 * factory's `@param` lists half the properties it is handed, or an object literal is filled in
 * later, and fixing them all at once would be one unreviewable change across fifteen files.
 *
 * So the count is written down per file, and this refuses a run where any file has more errors than
 * its line in the baseline, or where a file appears that had none. Fewer is always fine, and the
 * message says which file improved and asks for the baseline to be lowered. It is the same shape as
 * the coverage floor in package.json: a line that only moves one way.
 *
 *   node tools/typecheck.mjs            check against .github/typecheck-baseline.json
 *   node tools/typecheck.mjs --update   write what is there now as the new baseline
