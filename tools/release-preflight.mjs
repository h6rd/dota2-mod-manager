/*
 * Before a release is built: will everything after publishing work?
 *
 * The jobs after publish need things this repository keeps elsewhere: the Discord webhook, the
 * bucket keys, the antivirus workflow, a changelog section in both languages. Each of them has been
 * wrong once, and each time the first sign came after the release was public, when there was no
 * stopping it: 2.7.1 reached neither the mirror nor Discord. Here, in the gate, a wrong one stops
 * the release while it is still a tag, before anything is built.
 *
 * Nothing here changes anything. The webhook is read, not posted to: a GET on a Discord webhook
 * answers with its name and posts nothing.
 *
 * A beta is held to less: it is not announced and needs no changelog, so a missing webhook or
 * section is a warning there and an error for a release.
 *
 * Usage (release.yml, gate job):
 *   TAG=v2.8.0 BETA=false GH_TOKEN=... DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=... R2_...=... node tools/release-preflight.mjs
