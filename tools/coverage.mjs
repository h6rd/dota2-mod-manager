/**
 * The suite, with coverage that is allowed to get better and not worse.
 *
 * The floor used to be three numbers on the command line: lines 74, branches 76, functions 72.
 * An aggregate hides the thing worth catching. On 2026-09-16 the aggregate was 76.10% while
 * src/presets-service.js sat at 13.8% and src/installer.js at 48.5%, and a new module with no
 * tests at all moves the aggregate by a fraction of a point: well inside the slack, invisible.
 *
 * So the numbers are kept per file, and a run fails when a file drops more than half a point
 * below its line, or when a file that had coverage stops being measured at all. Better is always
 * fine and says so, asking for the baseline to be raised. The same shape as the type-error
 * ratchet in tools/typecheck.mjs, and the same rule: never lower a line to make a run pass.
 *
 * Platforms measure differently, which is why this is not one number for everybody. src/steam.ts
 * asks which operating system it is on and takes a different half of itself on each, so the same
 * file honestly reports 53% on one and something else on the other; measured on 2026-09-10, Linux
 * read 75.2% of lines against Windows' 74.8%, and the two swapped places on branches.
 *
 * So the baseline keeps a map of measurements, one per platform, and each machine is held to its
 * own. A line measured on one machine is not evidence about another, but it is evidence about
 * that machine: holding only the one it happened to be measured on left the per-file half
 * unenforced in CI on both runners, which is where it matters most. A platform with no
 * measurement yet is held to the aggregate alone and says so, and --update rewrites only the
 * platform it ran on. The aggregate floor is enforced everywhere: it sits below both platforms on
 * purpose, which makes it a floor rather than a fingerprint.
 *
 *   node tools/coverage.mjs            run the suite, then hold the line
 *   node tools/coverage.mjs --update   write what was measured as the new baseline
