/**
 * A copy of the mod archives that does not live on GitHub.
 *
 * The app already has a second source for the four files it needs to start: the site carries
 * those. What it had no answer for is the archives themselves. Every mirror it knows is a proxy
 * standing in front of GitHub, so the three-hour outage on 2026-08-17 meant nobody could
 * install anything at all. This puts the archives in Cloudflare R2, which is a different
 * company having a different bad day.
 *
 * What gets copied: the catalog lists every mod and the file it ships as. An object already
 * here at the size upstream reports is left alone, so a run only moves what actually changed -
 * and a mod its author has replaced does change, which this file claimed to notice and did not
 * until 2026-09-10. The free tier is 10 GB and the catalog is close to it, so there is a budget
 * - the categories people install from first go first, and the run stops when the budget is
 * spent instead of failing halfway through.
 *
 * The index written at the end is what keeps the app from guessing: without it, every install
 * of a mod that did not fit would cost a round trip to R2 and a 404 before falling back.
 *
 * No SDK. R2 speaks S3, S3 wants SigV4, and SigV4 is a hash of a canonical string: eighty lines
 * that never change, against a dependency with a supply chain.
 *
 *   node tools/r2-sync.mjs --limit 5     copy at most five archives, which is the smoke test
 *   node tools/r2-sync.mjs --budget 9    stop at nine gigabytes in the bucket
 *   node tools/r2-sync.mjs --dry         say what it would do and touch nothing
