/**
 * The big files may get smaller. They may not get bigger.
 *
 * On 2026-09-16 five files carried 7 155 lines between them while the median module in src/ was
 * 171: src/installer.js, renderer/views/catalog.js, renderer/views/library.js, main.js and src/vpk.js.
 * That was not a style, it was five outliers, and every one of them got there a hundred lines at a
 * time with nobody deciding to.
 *
 * So each of them has its size written down, and a run fails when one grows. Any file that is not
 * on the list fails when it crosses 300 lines, which is how a new outlier would have to announce
 * itself rather than arrive. The mark was 800 until 2026-09-27, when the window started moving to
 * one component per file: every file already past 300 then was written down at the size it had. `--update` writes the measurements back, and refuses to raise a
 * number: the only way a budget goes up is by editing the file by hand and saying why in the
 * commit, which is exactly the conversation that never happened the first five times.
 *
 * This is a budget, not a plan: splitting these files is separate work, and each split shows up
 * here as a number going down.
 *
 *   node tools/size-budget.mjs            check
 *   node tools/size-budget.mjs --update   write the measurements back (never upward)
