/*
 * A copy of the pinned toolchain that does not share GitHub's fate.
 *
 * src/toolchain.ts downloads Source 2 Viewer from its own project's GitHub release, pinned by
 * version and SHA-256, to read item icons out of the game's own files. Every mirror src/net.ts
 * knows is a proxy standing in front of GitHub, so when GitHub is down the whole chain is, and
 * the feature falls back to scraping the wiki.
 *
 * This puts the archive in the bucket the mods already live in. Safe from anywhere, and that is
 * what a pin is for: the digest lives in this project's source rather than travelling with the
 * URL, so whoever hands the bytes over cannot also decide what they should hash to. Nothing is
 * uploaded until it has been checked against that digest here as well.
 *
 * Only the pinned versions are kept, so a bumped pin leaves nothing behind.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/r2-toolchain.mjs [--dry]
