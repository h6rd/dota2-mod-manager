/*
 * After a release: is everything that should have happened, done - and if not, do it.
 *
 * release.yml publishes, then three jobs finish the job: the update mirror, the Discord post and
 * the antivirus check. On 2.7.1 and 2.8.0-beta.1 a failed step skipped all three, the release was
 * public, the run was red, and the mirror sat on 2.7.0 for days while nobody re-ran anything. A red
 * run is a thing somebody has to notice. This notices instead, every few hours and right after
 * every release run, and puts right what it can:
 *
 *   - the mirror: compared with GitHub by version and by size, and brought up to date when it is
 *     behind (tools/r2-release.mjs --current);
 *   - the Discord post: sent when the release run did not send it, and marked in the release notes
 *     so it is sent once;
 *   - the antivirus check: asked for when nothing has run it since the release went out.
 *
 * What it cannot put right it says, and the run goes red: a published release missing a file (an
 * immutable release cannot gain one; the next version has to carry it), a post Discord keeps
 * refusing, a check that ran and wrote nothing.
 *
 * Releases published before WATCH_FROM are only held to the mirror: 2.7.1 went out without a
 * Discord post on purpose, and announcing it now would be news three days late.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/release-watch.mjs            look, change nothing
 *        node tools/release-watch.mjs --repair   look, and put right what can be
