/**
 * The radar: everything that is waiting on a person, in one place that keeps itself current.
 *
 * On 2026-09-15 an outside review read this repository as half abandoned. Nothing was broken
 * that day; things were simply waiting and nobody was reminded. Four pull requests had sat for
 * days, six CodeQL alerts were open, issue #3 had said "first week" for a month because its
 * script lost its memory, SECURITY.md sent reporters to a feature that was switched off, and the
 * personal token the catalog bot pushed with expired the same evening. Each of those was
 * visible to anyone who looked. None of them told anybody.
 *
 * So once a day this reads what GitHub and the repository know, rewrites the body of one pinned
 * issue ("Project status") with what needs a decision, what is red, what is about to expire and
 * what is worth a look, and, when something has waited longer than CONTRIBUTING.md and
 * SECURITY.md promise, sends the maintainer one Discord message. It never closes, labels or
 * comments on anybody's issue: a bot closing people's reports reads worse than silence.
 *
 * The decisions are pure functions over plain data (evaluate, renderIssue, renderDiscord) and are
 * tested against fixtures in test/radar.test.js. The part that talks to GitHub is thin on purpose.
 *
 * Two security lists stay out of reach. The workflow token cannot read Dependabot or secret
 * scanning alerts: a dry run on 2026-09-16 got neither, and the credential registry refuses
 * personal tokens. Vulnerable dependencies come from `npm audit` instead, which reads the same
 * advisory database from the lockfile and needs no token. Leaked secrets have no substitute here:
 * push protection refuses the known kinds at the door, and GitHub emails the owner about the rest.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   GH_TOKEN=... node tools/radar.mjs            # update the issue, alert when overdue
 *   GH_TOKEN=... node tools/radar.mjs --dry      # print both, write nothing
