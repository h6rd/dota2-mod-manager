/*
 * A second place to get an update from.
 *
 * The app updates itself out of GitHub Releases and nowhere else, so on 2026-08-17, when GitHub
 * was down for three hours, no copy of this app could have checked for or fetched an update.
 * Nobody noticed, because an app that fails to update looks exactly like an app. It becomes
 * visible on the day a release fixes something urgent, and by then it is too late to arrange a
 * second route.
 *
 * The mods and the catalog already have one (tools/r2-sync.mjs). This puts the release itself
 * there too: the manifests electron-updater reads and the binaries they point at, under
 * updates/ in the same bucket, served from cdn.dota2modmanager.com.
 *
 * Only the current release is kept, and the current beta when one newer than it is out, so the
 * bucket carries about 320 MB for updates (640 with a beta) rather than 320 MB per release for
 * ever. Old versions stay on GitHub, which is where anybody looking for one goes.
 *
 * A beta shares the folder and not the names: its binaries carry -beta, and its two manifests are
 * rewritten to ask for those. The bucket also holds the mod mirror and was at 8.77 GB of the free
 * 10 GB in September 2026, so a second copy of every release was not worth 320 MB for ever.
 * tools/mirror-plan.js decides all of that and is tested; this fetches and uploads.
 *
 * --current is what release.yml and tools/release-watch.mjs run. It asks GitHub which release and
 * which beta are out and puts the folder in that state, whatever state it was in: until 2026-09-26
 * each run published one version, so a run that was skipped (2.7.1, 2.8.0-beta.1) left the mirror
 * behind until the next release, and nothing ran it again. --check only reads what the mirror
 * serves and compares it with GitHub, by version and by size, which a HEAD request answering 200
 * never did: an old latest.yml answers 200 too.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/r2-release.mjs --current [--dry]   the mirror as it has to stand now
 *        node tools/r2-release.mjs --check             does it stand that way (no credentials)
 *        node tools/r2-release.mjs <version> [--dry]   one version, e.g. 2.6.5 or 2.7.0-beta.1
