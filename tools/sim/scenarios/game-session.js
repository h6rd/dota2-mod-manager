/**
 * A session with the game: safe mode switched off with the game running and then closed, Steam
 * updating the game while it runs, and Steam checking the game's files while the app is open.
 * After each, tools/sim/dota.js asks whether the game would load what the app left.
 *
 * What the app promises (src/game-upkeep.ts, src/ipc-game.ts, src/patch-watch.ts):
 *   - it does not write gameinfo while the game holds it open, and says so;
 *   - an update that lands while the game runs is noticed, the repair waits for the game to
 *     close, and My mods says why the mods are off until then;
 *   - once the game is closed the repair runs, by itself or on "I closed it, retry".
 *
 * The game and Steam are played by tools/sim/world.js inside the sandbox.
