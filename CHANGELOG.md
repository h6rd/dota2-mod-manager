# Changelog

What changed in each release. The app updates itself, so you get all of this without reinstalling.

## 2.9.0

### Mods load again after Dota's 7 October update

With safe mode off, Dota's 7 October update could stop the mods in your language folder from
loading. Weather and items kept working, the rest did not.

To let mods change items, the app adds its own folder to the list of places Dota reads, and it
copies that list from Dota's own file. The update renamed one line in Dota's file. The copy the
app had written before the update kept the old name, and the game skipped your language folder.

The app now compares its copy with Dota's file at every start and while it is open, and writes it
again when they differ. Opening this version is enough. With safe mode on, nothing broke.

### My mods names the mods a Dota update reached

A mod replaces some of Dota's files with its own copies. When an update changes one of those files,
the mod keeps putting its old copy back, and sometimes a HUD or a screen breaks.

From this version on, the app notes which of Dota's files your mods replace. After the next Dota
update, a mod whose files the update changed or removed gets a pre-patch mark in My mods, and the
banner about the update names it. If something in the game looks off after a patch, start with
those mods. The mark goes away once the mod's author updates it and you install the new version.

### What's new keeps paragraphs apart

This window ran a section's second paragraph into the first, as you could see in the 2.8.0
notes. Each paragraph now stands on its own.

## 2.8.0

Everything the four 2.8.0 betas brought, now for everybody.

### Items: a hero's default items in the look of any of its wearables

Cosmetics → Items lists every hero. Open one, pick a slot and choose any of that hero's
wearables: the default item in that slot takes its look. Only you see it, and no mod file
changes. You can add particle effects on top, one or several: fire, lightnings, frostbloom, snow,
bubbles, sand storm and ghost. Frostbloom and snow do not hold on every model.

Nothing reaches the game until you press Equip. Each item you put on is a row in My mods with its
effects named, and turns off like any mod. A hero's window opens with Sets: Equip the whole set
puts every piece on at once, each as its own row. A piece the builder leaves alone, such as an
arcana, stays in the window, dimmed, with the reason.

### Heroes opens on a grid of heroes

Heroes in the catalog used to be 463 mod cards in one run. It now opens on one tile per hero,
with the hero's portrait, how many mods it has and whether you have one installed. Press a hero
to see its mods. The switch in the toolbar brings the list back.

### The window moves

Every screen was redrawn on new foundations, and things now move to where they go instead of
jumping there. In the catalog the highlight slides to the category you pick, and a mod window
opens out of its card. In My mods a mod you move up or down the load order slides to its new
place, a removed mod folds away, and a pack's contents open instead of popping in. A switched-off
mod is dimmed, so you can see at a glance what the game will load. If Windows is set to show fewer
animations, the app keeps still.

### Shaders, trees and river load first

Slots 02-29 now belong to shaders, trees, river, hero effects, ranged attacks, hero items and
optimization, and every other mod starts at 30. Before, moving a hero mod above a shader could
trade their slots. Moving and dragging now keep a mod inside its own part. If your order comes
from an earlier version, the app lays it out once at start, while Dota is closed: it keeps your
order inside each part and tells you the order changed.

### The anti-cheat notice says what to do

When Dota cannot check the game before matchmaking, it shows a Valve Anti-Cheat window saying your
machine could not be verified, and with mods installed that reads like a ban on the way. Usually
the cause is a damaged install or a Steam that needs a restart. The app now replaces the text of
that window with the steps that fix it: verify the game files in Steam, restart Steam, and turn
mods off with the Mods switch. The text follows the language the game shows, in all 28 of them.

It lives in one file of the app's own, pak64 in the language folder. It is not a mod: My mods does
not list it, the Mods switch leaves it on, and uninstalling the app removes it. If one of your mods
sat in slot 64, it moves to the next free slot.

### Whole-map terrains built for an older map

Some catalog terrains, the TI and Dota+ ones among them, replace the whole map, so each carries
Valve's map as it was on the day it was built. After Valve updates the map, such a terrain can
remove trees, cost frames and get matchmaking refused. The catalog and My mods now mark these
terrains "old map". When the game's map changes, the app switches an old one off once and tells
you. If you turn it back on, it stays on until the next map update.

### 18+ mods stay hidden until you say yes

The catalog marks five mods 18+: explicit hero models. The app asks once whether you are 18 and
want them shown. Until you say yes, they are hidden from the catalog, the search, Recently added
and Favorites. Settings → Catalog has a switch to change the answer. Mods you already installed
stay in My mods as they are.

### Every author of a mod

A mod's window credits everybody the catalog names on it: its authors, the people who reworked it
and the people who sent it in, each linked to their page. Before, it named the first author, and
the other two links opened a page that does not exist.

### Fixes

- Checking the game's files in Steam while the app was open turned your mods off until a restart.
  The app now notices the check and puts its patch back.
- Moving a mod in the load order while Dota or an antivirus held one of its files could leave the
  mod split between two slots, and swapping two mods in that moment could delete one of them. A
  move now happens whole or not at all.
- A settings file saved with a byte order mark, as Notepad saves it, lost every setting on the
  next start, the game path included. It now loads.
- On a first start with no internet and nothing cached, presets could not be listed, shared or
  applied. They work now.
- Next to Minify, My mods showed a yellow warning that contradicted itself even when nothing was
  wrong, and could name the folder "dota_null". It now names the folder the game reads, and warns
  only when your mods are the ones not loading.
- When the wiki answered with a server error for a cosmetic's picture, the app took that for "no
  picture" and showed none for a week. It asks again next time now.
- On a short window, such as a 1366x768 laptop at 125%, the safe mode window cut off its title and
  both buttons. It fits now.
- After switching to English, the sign-in button and the mods switch stayed in Russian until a
  restart.
- A tab pressed right after switching screens could do nothing, and a search typed on another
  screen opened the home screen with no results.
- The download bar stayed on screen after Source 2 Viewer finished downloading.
- A preview paused in its first second started playing anyway. It stays paused.
- Applying a preset with a mod the catalog lists without a file no longer tries to download a file
  called "undefined".
- The support report you send from Settings now says whether download mirrors are failing, which
  tools are installed, and whether item-table changes wait for a rebuild.

### Thanks

h6rd wrote the item builder, and develops it further with TheFleece. Thanks to the testers who ran
the four betas.

## 2.8.0-beta.4

A fourth beta for the testers on the list. Everything in it, and in the betas before it, reaches
everybody with 2.8.0.

### The window moves

Every screen was redrawn on new foundations, and things now move to where they go instead of
jumping there:

- In the catalog, the highlight slides to the category you pick. A chip or a filter slides the
  cards that stay into their new places and fades the rest. A mod window opens out of its card.
- In My mods, a mod you move up or down the load order slides to its new place, passing over its
  neighbour. A mod you remove, or that the search leaves out, folds away and the rows below close
  the gap. A pack's contents open and close instead of popping in.
- A deleted preset folds away, a preset's contents open to their height, and a setting you change
  swaps its value in place.

A drag in My mods drops without an extra animation. If Windows is set to show fewer animations,
the app keeps still. A switched-off mod in My mods is now dimmed, so you can see at a glance what
the game will load.

Apart from the motion, nothing should look different. If something does, tell us in Discord.

### Fixes

- Moving a mod in the load order while Dota or an antivirus held one of its files could leave the
  mod split between two slots, where neither the game nor My mods could find it. Swapping two mods
  in that moment could delete one of them. A move now happens whole or not at all.
- On a first start with no internet and nothing cached, presets could not be listed, shared or
  applied. They work now.
- On a short window, such as a 1366x768 laptop at 125%, the safe mode window cut off its title and
  both buttons. It fits now.
- When Minify builds into the same folder as the app, the My mods banner could name that folder
  "dota_null". It names the right one.
- A preview paused in its first second started playing anyway. It stays paused.
- The support report you send from Settings now says whether download mirrors are failing, which
  tools are installed, and whether item-table changes wait for a rebuild. Those parts were missing
  or showed an error.
- Applying a preset with a mod the catalog lists without a file no longer tries to download a file
  called "undefined".
- When a failed change cannot put a file back, usually because Dota holds it open, the app writes
  that to its log, so a support report shows it.

## 2.8.0-beta.3

A third beta for the testers on the list. Everything in it, and in the two betas before it,
reaches everybody with 2.8.0.

### 18+ mods stay hidden until you say yes

The catalog marks five mods 18+: explicit hero models. The app now asks once whether you are 18
and want them shown. Until you say yes, they are hidden from the catalog, the search, Recently
added and Favorites. Settings → Catalog has a switch to change the answer. Mods you already
installed stay in My mods as they are.

### Fixes

- A settings file saved with a byte order mark, as Notepad saves it, lost every setting on the
  next start, the game path included. It now loads.

## 2.8.0-beta.2

A second beta for the testers on the list. Everything in it, and in 2.8.0-beta.1, reaches
everybody with 2.8.0.

### The anti-cheat notice says what to do

When Dota cannot check the game before matchmaking, it shows a Valve Anti-Cheat window saying your
machine could not be verified, and with mods installed that reads like a ban on the way. Usually
the cause is a damaged install or a Steam that needs a restart. The app now replaces the text of
that window with the steps that fix it: verify the game files in Steam, restart Steam, and turn
mods off with the Mods switch. The text follows the language the game shows, in all 28 of them.

It lives in one file of the app's own, pak64 in the language folder. It is not a mod: My mods does
not list it, the Mods switch leaves it on, and uninstalling the app removes it. If one of your mods
sat in slot 64, it moves to the next free slot.

### Whole-map terrains built for an older map

Some catalog terrains, the TI and Dota+ ones among them, replace the whole map, so each carries
Valve's map as it was on the day it was built. After Valve updates the map, such a terrain can
remove trees, cost frames and get matchmaking refused. The catalog and My mods now mark these
terrains "old map". When the game's map changes, the app switches an old one off once and tells
you. If you turn it back on, it stays on until the next map update.

## 2.8.0-beta.1

A beta for the testers on the list. Everything in it reaches everybody with 2.8.0.

### Items: a hero's default items in the look of any of its wearables

Cosmetics → Items lists every hero. Open one, pick a slot and choose any of that hero's
wearables: the default item in that slot takes its look. Only you see it, and no mod file
changes. You can add particle effects on top, one or several: fire, lightnings, frostbloom, snow,
bubbles, sand storm and ghost. Frostbloom and snow do not hold on every model.

Nothing reaches the game until you press Equip. The bar along the bottom of the window shows what
goes on, and its button reads Equip, Save effects or Back to default. Each item you put on is a
row in My mods with its effects named, and turns off like any mod.

### Whole sets in one press

A hero's window opens with Sets. Choose a set to see its pieces by slot, and Equip the whole set
puts them all on at once, each as its own row in My mods. A set comes without effects: open a
piece to add them. A piece the builder leaves alone, such as an arcana, stays in the window,
dimmed, with the reason.

### Heroes opens on a grid of heroes

Heroes in the catalog used to be 463 mod cards in one run. It now opens on one tile per hero,
with the hero's portrait, how many mods it has and whether you have one installed. Press a hero
to see its mods. The switch in the toolbar brings the list back.

### Shaders, trees and river load first

Slots 02-29 now belong to shaders, trees, river, hero effects, ranged attacks, hero items and
optimization, and every other mod starts at 30. Before, moving a hero mod above a shader could
trade their slots. Moving and dragging now keep a mod inside its own part, and a mod you import
and then link to the catalog moves to the part its category belongs in. If your order comes from
an earlier version, the app lays it out once at start, while Dota is closed: it keeps your order
inside each part and tells you the order changed.

### Every author of a mod

A mod's window credits everybody the catalog names on it: its authors, the people who reworked
it and the people who sent it in, each linked to their page. Before, it named the first author,
and the other two links opened a page that does not exist.

### Fixes

- Checking the game's files in Steam while the app was open turned your mods off until a
  restart. The app now notices the check and puts its patch back.
- A tab pressed right after switching screens could do nothing, and a search typed on another
  screen opened the home screen with no results.
- After switching to English, the sign-in button and the mods switch stayed in Russian until a
  restart.
- The download bar stayed on screen after Source 2 Viewer finished downloading, and froze where a
  failed download stopped.
- Next to Minify, My mods showed a yellow warning that contradicted itself even when nothing was
  wrong. It now names the folder the game reads, and warns only when your mods are the ones not
  loading.

### Thanks

h6rd wrote the item builder, and develops it further with TheFleece.

## 2.7.1

### The project moved to github.com/dota2modmanager

The repository now belongs to an organization with two maintainers, and every change is read by
the one who did not write it before it ships. This version looks for updates and for the
project's notices at the new address, and its GitHub link goes there too. Older versions keep
working: GitHub forwards the old address, so there is nothing for you to do.

The Download button in your Discord status now opens dota2modmanager.com instead of the old page
on GitHub.

### Your Windows user name stays out of the diagnostic report

The report listed the folders it looked at by their full path, and a path inside your home folder
carries your Windows user name. That part is now written as `%USERPROFILE%` (`~` on Linux), so
a report you paste into Discord shows the folder and not who you are.

### Electron 44.4.3

The engine the app runs on moves from 44.3.0 to 44.4.3, with the fixes Electron shipped in
between.

### Thanks

Omkar Nikam wrote the diagnostic report change. It is the second pull request he has sent here.

## 2.7.0

### A beta channel, for the people who asked to be first

A few accounts now get builds before everybody else. If yours is one of them, Settings has a
switch under Discord; if it is not, there is nothing there and nothing to miss. Signing out of
Discord gives up the beta with it.

The list is held in a signed file the app reads on its own, so being added or taken off it does
not wait for an update, and it holds a fingerprint of a Discord account rather than the account.

Staged rollout was dropped here for a good reason: an urgent fix has to reach everybody at once.
This is the other half of that argument, a few people who know they are running what has not been
released yet.

### The Download button works again in the portable build

A portable copy that found an update answered "no update" when you pressed Download, and has
done since 2.3.0. It read which version to fetch once at start-up, before any check had run, so
the answer was always empty. Installed copies replace themselves and were never affected.

### Fonts and cursors stop coming back after you remove them

Since 2.0.0 the app put back any font or cursor that Steam's file check had replaced, and it
decided what to put back by comparing files. A mod that ships some of Valve's files unchanged
looked identical at once: one install logged the same cursor set as "restored after verify" 29
times in August, and removing such a mod could leave its files behind as if they were the game's.

Every font and cursor the app writes is now recorded by its hash. A file holding what the app
wrote is the app's file, and it is no longer mistaken for the game's. A copy installed before this
reports the old way once more, and putting it back writes the record.

### A cosmetic pick, called what it actually is

The window and the site used to say "free cosmetics". That was never quite true, and it hid the
part worth knowing: the app takes the standard item your account already has and draws it with the
look of another one, in its own copy of the game's item table. Nothing is bought, nothing enters
your inventory, and only you see it. Every text now says that instead.

### Every release is scanned, and the result is published

Two false positives reached people before anybody here knew there was something to answer. Each
release is now looked up on VirusTotal by the checksum it already carries, and the verdict goes
into the release notes as a table with a link for every file, whatever it says.

### Smaller things

- The app can be told about another place to download mods from without shipping an update, which
  matters on the day GitHub is unreachable.
- A damaged VPK tree or archive is refused in this app's own words rather than crashing or
  reaching you in a library's.
- A language folder that has to be created is created in one step, so a slow disk cannot leave it
  half made.

## 2.6.12

### A technical release

Nothing in the window looks or behaves differently. This one is about how a release reaches you.
The machinery below was built this week, and it should be tried on a release nobody is waiting for
rather than on an urgent fix.

### A release is installed and used before anybody can get it

Until now CI built the installer and published it in the same breath. Two releases in September
went out with installing broken: every check was green, because nothing had ever pressed the
button.

A release is now created as a draft, which no installed copy can update to. CI takes the installer
and the AppImage from that draft, installs them, and clicks through the app: install a mod, switch
it off, restart, switch it on, remove it, checking the game folder on disk after every step. Only
when both pass does the release become public, for everybody at once.

### Every file of a release can be checked

Each release now carries `SHA256SUMS`, the SHA-256 of every file on it, and a signature for that
list made by the release workflow itself. If you want to be sure the installer you downloaded is
the one this repository built, with the GitHub CLI:

```
gh attestation verify Dota-2-Mod-Manager-Setup.exe --repo TheFleece/dota2-mod-manager
```

Beside it is a list of what the app ships inside it. The README and SECURITY.md show the other ways
to check a download.

### Notices in the app expire on their own

The app can put a dated notice in front of you, and until now one stayed until somebody remembered
to take it down. The thank-you for hanta's video was meant to run for a week in August and was
still on screen in the middle of September. A notice now carries the last day it is shown, and that
one is gone.

### One less pointless request at every start

The app asked GitHub for a settings file that was never published, got a 404 and carried on with
what was built into it. It no longer asks.

## 2.6.11

### Built on Electron 44

The app moves from Electron 43 to 44, and with it to a newer Chromium carrying the last month of
security fixes. Nothing in the window should look or behave differently. Before this went out, a
catalog mod was installed through the window on 44 and landed on disk the same way it did on 43.

### The zip library, updated for a security advisory

adm-zip, which the app uses to read mod archives, had an advisory: when it unpacks an archive onto
disk, it follows links already sitting in that folder, so a crafted archive could write a file
outside it. This app never lets adm-zip unpack onto disk. It reads each file into memory, checks
its path and size, and writes it itself, so no mod you installed could have used the hole. The
fixed version is in anyway, together with a newer YAML reader for the update check.

## 2.6.10

### Matchmaking works again after a Dota update

With mods on, a Dota update could leave the game refusing to queue. Nothing in the app looked
wrong: it reported the patch on, signed and in order.

Dota ships a list of hashes for the files it checks, and it ships a new one with every build.
This app adds one line to that list for the file it edits. What it got wrong was where it read
the rest of the list from: a copy it had saved the first time you turned mods on, which on one
machine was six weeks and a dozen Dota patches old. So after an update it put that old list back,
the client compared its own current binaries against hashes from weeks earlier, and refused to
queue.

It now writes the list the installed build shipped, plus its one line. The saved copy is not read
any more.

**If queueing is still refused after this update:** the old list may still be sitting in your game
folder, and nothing this app does can know what the right one was. Steam, Dota 2, Properties,
Installed Files, Verify integrity of game files puts it back, and takes a minute. The next Dota
patch replaces it too.

### A preset brings back the mods it names

Applying a preset whose mods were no longer installed switched every other mod off, switched on
only the members still there, and said "Preset applied". The card above the button already said
how many of its mods were missing; the button just never did anything about it.

Now the mods the catalog still has are installed first, and then the preset is applied. A mod of
your own that is not on this computer cannot be fetched from anywhere, so the app names it instead
of leaving it out without a word.

## 2.6.9

### Safe mode can be switched off on Linux

It could not before. Pressing the switch answered `dota.signatures not found` and stopped there,
which meant no mod could be loaded by the game at all on Linux.

The file it was looking for does not exist there. On Windows the client keeps a list of hashes in
`bin/win64/dota.signatures` and checks the files it loads against it, so this app has to write its
own line into that list. Valve's Linux build ships `bin/linuxsteamrt64/` with the client, forty
shared libraries and no list at all, and the app treated that as a broken installation rather than
as a different one.

Nothing about it needs signing on Linux, so the patch is simply written and that is the whole job.
The switch also stops showing a warning dot for a list that was never there, and the app stops
re-applying a patch it thought had failed.

Reported with a photograph of the folder, which is what made it obvious.

### Updates have a second source on Linux too

They were supposed to since 2.6.5, and for Linux they never did: the mirror was filled before the
Linux build existed, so it carried the Windows files and nothing else. Four releases went out that
way. Both Linux files are on it now, and a release that leaves any of the six behind fails loudly
instead of quietly.

## 2.6.8

### A preset someone shared with you finishes

Opening a shared preset file installed everything in it, wrote it to your library, and then
stopped one line short of switching the mods on. Nothing said so: the window went on waiting for
an answer that had already failed. The same file split that broke Install in 2.6.5 broke this,
in the same way, and nobody had reported it because reaching it needs a preset file from another
player.

### An action that fails says so

Any failure in the process behind the window used to leave the button it belongs to stuck on
"Installing...", with the reason written only to a log file. That is how a plain error looked
like a hang for two releases. The button now comes back and the reason is on screen.

## 2.6.7

### Installing a mod works again

It did not in 2.6.5 or 2.6.6. Pressing Install did nothing at all: the button sat on
"Installing…", no progress, no error, and nothing was ever written. Every mod, everybody.

The handler behind that button checks one thing before it starts - whether installing has been
switched off from our side, which it never has been. When the process code was split into files
on 6 September, that check moved to one file and the function it calls stayed in another. It
threw on the first line, before anything was downloaded, and the window went on waiting for an
answer that was never coming.

Nothing was damaged by it. No file was written, no mod half-installed. The button was lying
about being busy.

The check now lives in one place that both files are handed, and the tests here register every
one of these handlers for real and call it, instead of reading the files as text and finding
the names all present.

## 2.6.6

### Mods that would not install now install

2.6.5 started checking every archive against the checksum its author publishes, and refused
anything that did not match. Two things then went wrong on the same day, and between them they
took mods away from people who had done nothing.

One mirror was serving old copies. The job that fills it skipped any file already there under
the same name, so a mod its author had replaced kept its old bytes for as long as the name
stayed the same. Twenty-four of them, one since August. Anybody who cannot reach GitHub is
served from that mirror first, got the old file, and the check said no.

And the check said no was the end of it. A download stopped at the first mirror that disagreed,
while three others holding the current file were never asked. That is now the other way round: a
wrong checksum costs that mirror its turn and the next one is asked. All twenty-four mirrored
copies have been replaced as well.

The list itself can also be wrong. It is rebuilt by a bot, and on 10 September it named a hash
for one mod that no copy of that file has ever had - so that mod was refused for everybody,
whatever their connection. When nothing matches, the app now takes what the catalog's own host
serves rather than refusing a mod over a list that has not caught up. What a mirror hands over
still has to match: none of them can give you bytes that GitHub did not.

The app's own updates and the toolchain behind item icons are held to their checksums exactly as
before. Those are pinned here, and a mismatch there is the thing being guarded against.

### And it says so in your own language

A refused download used to report itself as `checksum mismatch for Some Mod.zip`, in English, in
the middle of a Russian interface. It now says the file does not match what the mod's author
published and to try later.

## 2.6.5

### The app keeps working when GitHub does not

Everything here has come from GitHub: the catalog, the mods, the previews, the updates. On
17 August GitHub was down for three hours and none of it worked, and for a good part of the
userbase it is not reachable on an ordinary day either. Every one of those now has a second
place to come from.

The mods themselves: a quarter of the catalog had never reached the copy this app falls back
to. Five categories are stored differently from the rest and the job that fills it walked past
them, so 313 mods (item effects, hero items, creeps, denies and towers) were installable only
while GitHub answered. They are all there now.

The previews: those were fetched straight from GitHub, so a catalog full of empty squares was
what anybody blocked from it saw. A picture that does not arrive is fetched again from the
copy, and if that fails too the tile says so instead of leaving a grey rectangle.

Updates: the app checked GitHub Releases and nothing else. It now falls back to our own copy,
both for the installed build and for the portable one, and goes back to GitHub as soon as it
answers. The manifest and the file it describes always come from the same place, so nothing
can hand over one version's checksum with another version's build.

And the icon toolchain, the 50 MB download behind item pictures for free cosmetics, has a copy
as well.

### It tells you what went wrong

Opening the app with no connection, before it had cached anything, used to put this where the
catalog should be:

    Could not load the catalog: fetch failed

That is Node's phrase for being unable to open a socket, printed at a person. There is now a
screen that says there is no connection, that the mods already installed keep working, and
that the catalog will be back when the connection is. A server that answers badly gets a
different message, because telling somebody to check a connection that works sends them to fix
nothing.

### The catalog is signed, and mods are checked against what its author published

The catalog is read through public proxies for anybody who cannot reach GitHub directly, and
until now nothing proved the list came from its author rather than from whoever was carrying
it. It carries his signature now, and this app refuses a catalog that does not verify.

Mod archives are checked the same way. They used to be trusted the first time they arrived and
compared against that first copy afterwards, which catches a substitution on every download
except the one that matters. The catalog now publishes a checksum for every archive and each
download is measured against it before anything reaches your game folder.

### The window opens at a size your screen has room for

On a 1366x768 laptop, and on any screen with Windows scaling at 125% or 150%, the app asked
for a window bigger than the desktop and got it. The part hanging off the bottom held the
launch bar and the end of every list, and nothing about it looked broken: the list scrolled,
and the rows it scrolled to were past the edge of the screen. Restarting did not help, because
the size was asked for again rather than remembered.

### A crash on some Windows setups

The watcher that notices a Dota update could take the whole app down with it, without an error
and without anything in the log. It happens when the path to your game is a short 8.3 name or
reaches the folder through a junction, which is the sort of thing a moved Steam library leaves
behind. Found by running the tests on Windows for the first time.

### Smaller things

- English users saw a catalog category called "Sound" that should have read "Audio". Thirteen
  translation keys were written twice and two of the pairs disagreed; the duplicates are gone
  and the build now fails if another one appears.
- A preset you share is wrapped in a page that hands it to the app, and that page lived on
  GitHub Pages, so the link would not open for anybody who cannot reach GitHub. New links point
  at dota2modmanager.com. Links you have already sent keep working.
- The site no longer runs an animation on phones that could make Safari give up on the tab
  after a few seconds of scrolling, and it loads pictures sized for the screen showing them.
- The Library said Minify was being left `pak65-67 and pak99` for a release after pak99
  stopped being reserved. It reserves 65 to 67, which is what it now says; a pak99 already on
  disk is still recognised as Minify's and left where it is.

## 2.6.4

### Mods reach the folder the game reads again, if you run the new Minify

Minify v1.14rc7 puts a command of its own in front of Dota in Steam's launch options, so that
pressing Play patches first. Storing that escapes the quotes around its path, and this app read
launch options up to the first quote and stopped there. It lost the `-language` sitting behind
it, concluded nothing was set, and went back to installing into the folder named by the voice
setting - which Dota does not mount while that option is there. Your mods were on disk, switched
on, in a folder nothing reads.

Launch options now parse the way Steam writes them. If your mods went quiet after Minify
updated, they come back on the next start of this app, and nothing has to be installed again.

### When Dota will not start, the Library says why

That same Minify setting is "Run patches upon launch if required", and it is on by default. It
can swallow a launch: if its patch decides your launch options need fixing, it closes Steam and
waits for it, and your launch goes down with Steam. This app is nowhere in that sequence, since
Play here opens the same `steam://` link the Play button in Steam does. It is the window you
have open when nothing happens, though, so it now tells you the wrapper is set, whose setting it
is, and where to switch it off.

### pak99 is back in circulation

Minify merged its English localization into pak66, so it will not write pak99 again and this app
can hand that slot out. A pak99 already sitting in your folder is still read as Minify's and
left alone.

### Colours changed once, then never again

Turn animations off in Windows and the mascot in the title bar worked on the first click of a
session and ignored every click after it. The spin now ends on a clock rather than on an
animation that never runs.

### Deleting mods no longer looks like deleting your presets

Clear out the Mods tab and every preset read "0 mods" above the words "empty (everything will be
switched off)". Nothing had gone: a preset remembers mods rather than installations, which is
what lets a build outlive a reinstall, and the card counted only the ones it could find on disk.
A preset now shows everything in it, with the mods you do not have drawn as outlines.

## 2.6.3

### The interface no longer needs the internet to draw itself

Every icon in the app is a glyph in a font, and that font was fetched from Google at startup
along with the two typefaces. When it did not arrive - no connection yet, a slow or blocked
network, a cache emptied by an update - each icon fell back to the word behind it, and the
window filled up with `campaign`, `shield` and `play_arrow` where the pictures should be.

The fonts now sit inside the app and are read from disk. Nothing about drawing the window
touches the network any more, and the window's content policy no longer permits it to.

## 2.6.2

### Updating no longer asks whether to delete your mods

2.6.1 shipped an uninstaller that asks what to take along with the app - the mods in the game
folder, the app's own data. It was supposed to appear when somebody removes the program. It
appeared during updates as well, with the boxes already ticked, because an update replaces a
version by running the old uninstaller and nothing checked for that.

Nothing was deleted unless the window was confirmed, and cancelling it left everything alone.
But being asked to delete your mods while merely updating is not something anybody should have
to read carefully, and I am sorry for the fright.

Updates are silent again. The questions appear only when the program is being removed from
Windows, and nothing destructive is ticked in advance any more: deleting mods and app data are
now yours to choose, not the app's to assume. Putting the game's own files back stays on by
default, because a game left carrying an edit with the app that undoes it gone is the one
outcome that cannot be fixed afterwards.

## 2.6.1

### Mods now go where the game is actually looking

A `-language` in Steam's launch options outranks the language setting inside Dota. The app did
not know that, so on a machine with one set it did the worst possible thing: it wrote the voice
language back on every start, lost every time, and left your mods in a folder the game never
opens - while telling you everything was fine. Nothing was broken and nothing was lost; the
mods were simply somewhere nothing reads.

It follows the launch option now. If it names a language Dota knows, that folder is where mods
go, and mods already installed move themselves there on the next start. Remove the option later
and they move back on their own. Nothing changes for anyone without one.

This is also what makes running alongside Minify work rather than merely be described: Minify
is what puts the option there, so following it means both sets of mods end up in the one folder
the game reads.

### Everything the app said about Minify, corrected

A machine running the current Minify showed three notices at once that contradicted each other
and the game. All of it was wrong, and all of it is fixed.

Minify records the language you asked it for and the folder it writes to separately - ask for
English and it notes "english" while building into `dota_dutch` - and the app was reading the
wrong one, so it named a folder that exists nowhere and concluded that neither program's mods
were loading while Minify's plainly were. It also offered a button to move Minify's mods into
its own folder, had no wording at all for "the game is reading neither of us", and suggested
setting Minify to Russian, which for anyone whose game is not in Russian would have hardcoded
it there.

`pak99` joins `pak65` to `pak67` as slots the app will not use: that is where Minify writes its
English fix, and 99 was the last slot this app hands out, so a large library would have reached
it first.

### Smaller things

The Library no longer lists `dota_mods` - the app's own folder for free cosmetics - as if it
were a language. A language folder that already exists is left as it is instead of being given
a `gameinfo.gi` it never needed. And moving mods between folders skips anything another program
owns, whichever folder it is pointed at.

## 2.6.0

### Turning safe mode off now explains itself

It used to be one line of file names, and nobody read it. It is a proper window now: what the
app does today - drops its .vpk into a folder Dota already reads, touching nothing of the game -
and what it will do instead, with both files it edits named and what lands in each. Copies of
both are kept before the first write, so switching back puts them back byte for byte with
nothing left behind. Dota wipes that edit with every update and the app writes it back on its
own, which the window now says too. And the sentence that actually decides it: editing game
files counts as unsafe in Dota modding, no ban for it in 8+ years, no guarantees from us.

### Switching tabs, and importing a pile of mods

Opening a tab rebuilt the whole screen from nothing. Coming back to Heroes meant 513 cards
built again and about 90ms of frozen window, every time. Screens are kept now: around 30ms, and
it no longer grows with the size of the category. Each screen also remembers where it was
scrolled to, instead of inheriting the last one's position.

Importing a batch never let go of the app while it worked, so Windows put "not responding" on
the title bar for the several minutes a big pack takes. It hands control back between mods now,
and the bar counts them: "Reading mods 31 / 60" instead of one width until it is over.

### Removing mods

Deleting the file was never the slow part - it takes about two milliseconds. The wait was the
item table being rebuilt afterwards, and a selection paid for it once per mod. It is rebuilt
once for the whole batch now, and the rebuild itself went from 2.6 seconds to under half a
second. Twenty mods removed in about six tenths of a second, where the same twenty were close
to a minute.

### Presets keep what you saved

A preset used to hold the mods it named only as long as they stayed installed: delete one and
it was cut out of every preset, and reinstalling did not bring it back. Presets now remember
what a mod is rather than which copy of it was on the machine, so deleting one leaves the build
alone and installing it again anywhere fills the gap on its own. The card says how many of its
mods are not installed right now.

Free cosmetics are no longer part of a preset. A pick is not a mod - it owns no file and only
exists while safe mode is off - and folding the two together is why applying a build used to
strip whatever courier or weather you had chosen.

### Item pictures come from your own game

The cosmetics picker used to match items against a wiki: rate limited, wrong when two items are
named alike, and nothing at all offline. Almost every picture is already in the game in a form
that needs no decoding, so it now comes from there - correct for your build, instantly, with
nothing downloaded. The few that are stored compressed still fall back as before.

### Alongside Minify

[Minify](https://github.com/Egezenn/dota2-minify) loads mods the way this app does: by naming a
language folder, of which Dota mounts exactly one. So the app now reads Minify's own
configuration, works out which of the two the game is actually set to read, and says so -
including the case where its folder is not one the game reads at all, which is nothing to do
with us.

It also stays out of its way: the pak slots Minify writes are never used, the "disable all
mods" switch no longer renames its files, and its output is not offered in My mods as something
to adopt or delete. Its files are recognised by the marker it packs into what it builds, and
this app leaves a `dota2modmanager.json` naming its own, so either side can tell whose a file
is. Nothing of Minify is moved, renamed or deleted.

Where the two genuinely cannot both win, the app asks: Dota reads one map archive, so a terrain
and a Minify map mod are the same file. Installing one replaces the other, and you now hear
about it first.

### A launch option that overrules everything

Older guides hand out `-language something` freely. While it is there Dota takes both language
settings from it and mounts the folder it names, whatever this app does. The Library says so
now, and where to remove it.

## 2.5.1

### A skin that borrows from another hero comes in whole

The app reads which heroes a mod dresses from the models it carries, and two things fooled it.
A persona lives in a folder of its own - `models/heroes/antimage_female` is Anti-Mage's Wei,
`invoker_kid` is Invoker's Acolyte - so a pack that dresses one hero looked like a pack that
dressed two. And skins hang props from other heroes on themselves: a Clinkz set carries a
Phoenix immortal on its bow, a Sven one wears Disruptor's back piece. That one model counted as
a second hero.

An import that reads as two to four heroes cuts itself into a mod each, so both cases arrived as
two half mods: the bow in one, the hero in the other, each under a name that was half right.

A persona now reads as the hero it belongs to, along with the folder names Dota kept from before
a rename - bard, lanaya, drow, gyro, tuskarr and the rest - and a hero carrying under a quarter
of the leading hero's models reads as lent rather than dressed. Naming and cutting ask the same
question now, so a mod that comes in under the right name also comes in whole. Over 75 mods cut
out of one Skinchanger pack, the number that split themselves goes from three to none.

### The piece an item points at instead of shipping

A mod can point a default slot at one of Valve's own models and still be the author's work: he
repaints that item by shipping its textures, and his entry only ever names the model. Tinker's
Deep Sea Robot back is exactly that, and the import threw the entry away because the mod carries
nothing of the model it names, so the back never appeared on the hero at all.

Such an entry is now recognised by the item folder the mod's own textures sit in.

### Thanks

hanta made a walkthrough of the manager. His channel has a line in About now, beside the version
and the licence.

## 2.5.0

### The day GitHub is down is no longer your problem

On 17 August GitHub was out for three hours. Everything this app reads lives there: the
catalog, the mod archives, the file that recognises mods you installed by hand. The mirrors it
already had are all proxies standing in front of GitHub, so they went down with it. The window
opened, the catalog was empty, and nothing could be installed.

There are two more places to look now, and neither is GitHub. The catalog and its data are
copied onto the app's own site every time that site is built. All 915 mod archives sit in
object storage behind `cdn.dota2modmanager.com`, refreshed nightly. GitHub is still asked
first, because it is the source; the others answer when it cannot.

### A catalog that fails to update no longer disappears

If the app could not fetch a fresh catalog, it used to show you nothing, even with a perfectly
good copy already on your disk from an hour before. Now it shows the one it has and says so in
a line at the top. An old list of mods beats an empty window.

## 2.4.0

### It runs on Linux now

The release carries an AppImage. Make it executable, run it, and that is the whole installation.

Dota's Linux build keeps its mods in the same folders as the Windows one, so nothing about how
mods work changes. What had to learn a second platform is everything around them. The app finds
Steam where your distribution keeps it rather than in the Windows registry: the `~/.steam`
symlink, the XDG folder, the flatpak home, and both spellings of the steamapps directory, which
Windows forgives and Linux does not. It knows the game is running by asking for the process
instead of running a Windows tool. And it tells your desktop that it owns `d2mm://` links, so a
preset somebody sends you opens the app the same way it does everywhere else.

Being straight about how new this is: every change is built and started against a throwaway game
tree on Linux by our own CI, and somebody ran this build on a real desktop before it shipped.
That is a week of Linux against a year of Windows. If something looks wrong, the issue tracker is
the place, and it will be fixed faster than it was found.

### Small things

A Shadow Shaman mod whose folder is spelled `shadowshaman` said it was for "Shadowshaman". It
says Shadow Shaman.

## 2.3.0

### A portable build, for people who would rather not install anything

The release now carries a second file, `Dota-2-Mod-Manager-Portable.exe`. It runs from wherever
you put it, including a stick, and writes nothing into your system.

Portable here means the data comes with it. Your settings, your mod library and the download
cache go into a folder next to the exe, so the same stick on another machine comes up with
everything you already had. If that folder cannot be written to, which is what happens if you
drop it in Program Files, it falls back to the usual place and keeps working.

The one thing it cannot do is replace its own exe. So instead of updating in place it fetches
the new build, puts it beside the old one and tells you it is there. Nothing on your disk gets
rewritten, and the installer version updates itself exactly as before.

### Mods can no longer be installed where there is no game

Somebody moved his Steam library from C to F. Steam left the empty folder tree behind, as it
does. The app checked whether a folder named `dota` existed, decided it had found the game, and
installed forty-three mods into the leftovers. All forty-three were listed as installed. None of
them were anywhere the game could see.

The check is now for Valve's own files, not for a folder name, and it runs in three places: at
startup, where a path that stopped being an install gets replaced by the real one automatically;
in the folder picker; and before a download starts, so a mod with nowhere to go no longer costs
you 300 MB first.

If Dota cannot be found at all, the app says so and installs nothing. It always meant to. The
warning simply never appeared, because the old check called those leftovers a game.

### Small things

The release page could not be updated for a few minutes after 2.2.0 went out, which also left
its own update manifest split across two pages. Both are fixed, and the release now checks
itself before it is called done.

There is a `SECURITY.md` and a `security.txt` now, so anybody who finds a hole has a private
way to report it instead of a public issue.

## 2.2.0

Mostly work you will not see. Update anyway.

### The app trusts the catalog less than it used to

Mods, previews and guides come from a repository this app does not own, and when GitHub is
blocked they arrive through public proxies instead. That path used to be treated as friendly.
It is not, and this release stops treating it that way.

Guide text now passes through a fixed list of allowed tags, so a guide carries words and links
and nothing else. The window refuses to navigate away from its own page. A file name that
arrives with a catalog entry is used as a name and can no longer become a path. The one program
the app downloads and runs, the Source 2 reader, may now only come from that project's own
releases, and the file pinning its version is fetched from GitHub with no proxy in between.

The interface looks the same. Everything above is in the commit history if you want the detail.

### A current browser engine underneath

The app draws its window with the same engine a browser uses, and this one had been left ten
major versions behind, which means two years of published fixes it never received. It now runs
Electron 43, and the installer that ships it was rebuilt from scratch to check nothing broke on
the way.

### Mods follow the speech your game is set to

Dota mounts the folder named after your audio language, and the app used to answer that by
writing "russian" into your game for everyone. Korean speech now puts mods in `dota_koreana`,
Chinese in `dota_schinese`, Russian where it always went. Nothing is asked and nothing about
your game is changed.

English is the one language Valve mounts no folder for, so those mods go to `dota_russian` and
you hear no difference: Steam decides what gets downloaded, Dota decides what gets mounted, and
a folder with no voice pack in it serves mods while the speech keeps coming from the game's own
files. The English-voices switch is gone with it. Set English in Steam, which is where that
belongs.

### The program says who wrote it

A `NOTICE` file, a line in Settings under About, and two additional terms allowed by section 7
of the GPL: keep the credit, and give your version its own name. The licence is unchanged and
the app stays free software. Fork it, sell it, gut it. Say whose it was.

## 2.1.0

Everything here came from what people said after 2.0.

### Drag a mod to where it should load

The arrows moved a mod one slot per press, so getting a mod to load before
thirty others took thirty presses. Rows now have a grab handle. The list rearranges under the
pointer as you move it, the other rows slide out of the way, and it scrolls itself when you
near the top or bottom. Nothing is written to the game folder until you let go.

### Every mod shows its file

A row now prints its own file, named exactly as your mods folder names it, and carrying the
`.off` suffix when the mod is switched off. There was no other way to tell which of forty pak
files belonged to which mod.

### A preset looks like what it holds

A preset used to be its mod names joined by dots, which at eighty mods is a paragraph nobody
reads. It now leads with the covers of the mods in it and a line of counts by category, with
the full list one click away and grouped. A preset of eighty looks the same as a preset of ten.

### The window behaves like a window

Text no longer selects when you drag across a list, and pictures no longer pick up and follow
the mouse. Both used to happen while scrolling, and the second one ended with the app offering
to import the picture you had just dragged off its own card. Text fields still select, and so
does the file name on a mod row, which is the one string there worth copying.

The help menu no longer slides behind the mods when the page scrolls, and it closes when you
scroll away from it.

### The app says where it lives

The help menu now has the site next to the wiki and Discord, in the language the window is
speaking. Nothing in the program mentioned it before.

### A support report that says what is wrong

Same button, same file, same place to send it. Inside, the archive now opens with a one-screen
summary that starts with the verdict: if nothing is wrong it says so, and if something is, it
is named in plain words - the game is not patched, mods are going to a folder the game does
not mount, downloads are failing, the drive is nearly full. A second, full report next to it
carries everything for whoever is going to dig: the whole mod list in load order, the open
windows, the errors the interface reported, the updater and the config.

It also collects more: the two game files our patch edits, Dota's own console log if you have
ever run with `-condebug`, and listings of the app's own folders.

### Fixed

- The pill that says a mod is overruled had its icon sitting crooked next to its own text.
- "How many mods are overruled" was blank in every support report ever sent: the report asked
  for something that does not exist and quietly wrote nothing.
- Update errors were thrown away entirely, which is unhelpful when the report is that it never
  updates. They are still silent for you, and now recorded for a support report.

## 2.0.0

The whole app, rebuilt. Six tabs became four, the catalog was redrawn, and most of the
questions the app used to ask you it now answers itself.

### Four sections instead of six

Catalog, My mods, Presets, Settings. Guides moved inside the mod they explain: open a mod and
the guide is there, on the same card. Tools became what they always were, a category of the
catalog, so they sit in the rail with everything else.

### The catalog, redrawn

- Five columns instead of four, and a card that leads with the picture. Tags say what a mod
  changes; which item slot it fills is a dropdown, because that is one answer rather than a
  set. Both are translated now.
- A mod with several looks shows them as coloured buttons with their names on, and you can
  flip between them on the card itself without opening anything.
- An installed mod wears a green frame you can see from across the grid.
- Heroes is grouped hero by hero, A to Z, and scrolls four times faster than it did.
- Opening a mod takes a third of a second and comes out of the card you clicked.
- Counts are gone from the rail, the tiles and the headings. They were catalog statistics, and
  you came here to install a mod.

### An install list

Click the plus on a card to put a mod aside, keep browsing, then install everything at once.
The list has its own search, so a list eighty mods long is still a list you can work with.
That was the most asked-for thing in Discord: people were installing eighty mods one at a
time.

### It wears the hero you pick

Eight palettes from the catalog's own art, and a little animated mascot next to the logo that
switches between them. Click it and the whole window follows.

### My mods is a list again

A row is a picture, a name, a category and a switch. Everything rarer lives under the right
mouse button: rename, remove, open the folder, change the load order. The order is always
available, not only when something looks wrong.

### Sharing a setup is one button

One Share button opens one sheet: the link is already made and the file is next to it. It
says what each of the two carries, so nobody sends a link expecting it to include a mod that
is not in the catalog.

### It stopped asking about languages

The app no longer touches Dota's text language, keeps the voices Russian by itself, and puts
mods where the game actually looks for them. If your mods were stranded in another folder from
an older version, they move over on the first start. English voices are a single switch in
Settings, and turning them on leaves every mod in place.

### It survives a Dota patch

The app notices a game update when it lands rather than at the next start, and puts back what
the patch wiped. While Dota is running it does not write to the game folder at all: it says so
and waits for you to close the game.

### All of the change, or none of it

Installing, importing, switching and deleting now write to the game folder as one transaction.
If anything fails halfway, everything goes back to how it was, including the files that were
displaced to make room.

### Downloads that finish

Several mirrors instead of one, a download that resumes where it stopped, and a checksum on
what arrives. A half-finished file in the cache is re-fetched instead of installed.

### It puts back what Steam's file check takes away

Verifying game files in Steam removes the patch, the item table, the voice setup, fonts and
cursors. The app notices and restores all of it without asking.

### It reads the game rather than guessing

- Item pictures come from Dota's own files, so anything Valve adds appears without an app
  update and without downloading a 48 MB wiki dump.
- A mod that came with no picture gets one out of itself, from the art the author packed
  inside it.
- The app asks the game which items a mod replaces and who wears them, so a mod is named by
  what it actually does. A "bundle for 8 heroes" turned out to be one hero.
- A mod whose files are supplied by another mod is marked covered, and the app tells you which
  one the game is loading. It decides that by comparing the files themselves, so two mods that
  happen to carry the same stock file are not accused of fighting.
- A folder of loose game files can be turned into a mod, and a mod can be unpacked back into a
  folder. Drag a folder onto the window and it just works.

### Fixed

- **Favouriting a mod could stop installs from working.** Saving any setting made the app
  forget it had found Dota, so the catalog claimed the game was not installed and every
  install refused until you restarted. Present since 1.15.0.
- An archive can no longer lie about its size to make the app unpack a bomb, and a file inside
  an archive can no longer be written outside the folder it was meant for. That applied to any
  archive the app accepts, including a preset somebody sends you.
- Chips on a card stay on one line instead of pushing the card's own layout apart.
- After moving between screens, cards and buttons could stop responding. The app now waits for
  a screen to exist before wiring it up.
- My mods no longer breaks when there are files in the mods folder that the app did not put
  there.

## 1.15.0

### You decide which mod loads first

Dota mounts mod files in order, and the first copy of a shared file is the one you see. The
app used to work out who covered whom by comparing what every mod ships, then offer to swap
the two. It got that wrong far too often: two mods that happen to carry the same stock
texture are not fighting over anything, and a badge telling you a working mod is "covered"
helps nobody.

All of that is gone. The Library lists mods in the order the game loads them, and every row
has arrows. Move a mod up and its version of any shared file wins. No warning before an
install, no badge to decode, no button promising to sort it out for you.

### A file you put in the mods folder yourself is a mod

Such a file used to sit at the bottom of the Library as a row reading `pak90_dir.vpk`, with
an empty square where a picture goes and nothing you could do about it.

- The app reads the file and names it after what is inside, next to the portrait of the hero
  it turned out to be for.
- **Adopt** takes in any mod file now, not only the ones the catalog recognises. A file
  nobody has a name for joins your library as an import.
- A file byte-identical to a mod you already have is marked as a copy, so you can delete it
  instead of keeping two rows for one mod.
- Data volumes (`pak90_000.vpk`) belong to their index. They no longer show up as separate
  rows you cannot name or act on, and deleting the mod takes them with it.

### Sets, arcanas and item mods arrive with a name and a picture

The app knew where Dota keeps hero models and missed where it keeps cosmetic items:
`models/items/<hero>`, `materials/models/heroes` and the econ particle folders. A set or an
arcana therefore came out with no hero, no name, no category and no picture. All of those
read correctly now, down to which slots the set covers.

It also treated every spelling of a hero folder as a separate hero, so a single-hero skin
could claim to be a bundle of three and offer to split into parts that make no sense.
`crystalmaiden` and `crystal_maiden` are one hero again, and so are `nyx` and
`nerubian_assassin`.

### Presets

- A preset link used to vanish the moment your build held one mod of your own, with nothing
  said about why. It now carries the catalog mods and names what it had to leave behind, so
  you know to send the file for those.
- Mods arriving inside a shared preset get what a file you drag in gets: a name from their
  content, their item blocks lifted out, a split when one file holds several heroes.
- **Update** overwrites a preset with whatever is enabled right now, and the pencil renames
  it. Retyping the name exactly used to be the only way, and a typo quietly left you with a
  second preset.
- Drop a `.d2mm` anywhere in the window and it opens in Presets. Drop a `.vpk` anywhere and
  it imports. The tab you happen to be standing on no longer decides.

### Fixes

- Safe mode left Dota asking you to verify your files, with matchmaking refusing to start:
  the opposite of what safe mode is for. Switching it on puts back the one game file the app
  edits, and the app rebuilt that file one tab character shorter than the copy Dota ships.
  It still loaded, so nothing looked broken, but it no longer matched the signature Dota
  checks it against. The app now rebuilds the file exactly, verifies it against Dota's own
  signature list before writing it, and repairs a bad copy it saved earlier. When it cannot,
  it says so and points you at Steam's file check rather than leaving you to guess.
- Sharing a preset counted nine mods you had installed from the catalog as your own: it
  packed them into the file whole and left them out of the link. Five catalog sections list
  their mods in groups (creeps, towers, hero items, item effects, creep deny) and the app
  read only the ungrouped ones. A build that came out at 111 MB is half a megabyte now.
- Switching a mod off, or turning everything off with the master switch, cost imported mods
  their name, their content tag and their picture until you switched them back on. The app
  looked for a mod's file under its plain name, and a switched-off mod is renamed on disk.

## 1.14.3

### Fixes

- After Dota updated, safe mode left the game asking you to verify your files, and
  matchmaking would not start. Turning safe mode on rebuilds Dota's list of file
  signatures, and the app rebuilt it from a copy saved before the update: the list then
  described the older build instead of the files on your disk. Turning safe mode back on
  reapplied that same old copy, which is why only Steam's file check cleared it. The app
  now refreshes its copy whenever the game updates, and changes nothing in the list but
  its own line.

## 1.14.2

### Fixes

- A mod exported for someone else, or shared inside a preset, carried its models but not
  the item-schema blocks that give it effects and icons: the same blocks the app lifts on
  install and keeps on the record. It now carries a compact copy of them, read back the
  same way on the other side.
- Adopting a mod file another tool had already dropped into the mods folder skipped that
  same step: it became a library record, but its item blocks stayed unread and its effects
  never showed up.

## 1.14.1

### More cosmetics with a picture, fewer library rows with none

- Not every cosmetic's picture is filed under the name the game uses: some (couriers with
  their own wiki page, mostly) are illustrated with a plain screenshot under some other name
  entirely. The app now asks the wiki's exact page for its picture directly, instead of only
  ever guessing a file name.
- A "Loading Screen" or "Versus Screen" cosmetic with no picture of its own now falls back to
  its outfit's picture, for when the outfit has one and that exact screen doesn't.
- An imported mod recognised as skinning one hero shows that hero's own portrait instead of
  an empty box in the Library. An unmatched cursor set or an unsplit multi-hero import get a
  stand-in picture too, instead of nothing.

## 1.14.0

### A support report, one file instead of a round of screenshots

Settings has an **Export report** button now. It writes a single .zip: Dota's path and
language settings, the app's own settings, the installed mods, the patch state, a listing of
the mod folder's files, and the app's recent log. Send that instead of a screenshot and a
copy of your settings.json.

- The app now keeps a small log of its own on disk outside of testing too, so a crash you
  can't explain still leaves something to look at.
- Your Discord name is the only personal detail in the report, if you're signed in - no id,
  no picture, and the sign-in token was never saved to begin with.

### Fixes

- The three HUDs 1.13.0 said the wiki had no picture for now have one: Liquipedia keeps
  pictures for a few dozen looks Fandom never got, `Battle Pass 2022 HUD` among them, and
  the app asks it once Fandom has come up with nothing at all.

## 1.13.0

- **What's new, in the app.** The app updates itself in the background, so you used to be
  handed a new version with no idea what moved. Now it shows the changes once after an
  update, and Settings has a button to read them again.
- A shared preset link now opens a page that shows the whole build with pictures before
  anyone is asked to install anything.
- The catalog has a **Favorites** filter, the one the cosmetics already had. It shows what
  you starred without leaving the category.

### Fixes

- Cosmetics the wiki files under another spelling stayed blank tiles: the game writes
  `Aghanim's Labryinth 2021 HUD`, and it calls two HUDs a `Hud Skin` where the wiki does
  not. The app now asks the wiki which file it keeps such a look under. Three HUDs stay
  blank because the wiki has no picture for them at all.
- A mod whose preview is a video showed an empty box in the Library. You get its first
  frame, and a mod installed without a picture borrows the catalog's.
- Installing a pack dropped the picture of any mod that comes in several styles.

## 1.12.0

### Mods that share files now stack instead of fighting

Install a hero set and a separate item mod for the same hero, and both stay on. The one on
top supplies the files they share, so item mods from the catalog can be worn over a set.

- The Library says who is on top and who is covered, and a **Move up** button swaps the two.
- A fresh install goes on top of whatever it overlaps.
- The old warning claimed only one mod of the pair would load and told you to switch the
  other off. That was wrong.

### Fixes

- Mods shipped as several VPK volumes kept the packer's own file names for the data
  archives, which left half the mod under a name the game never mounts. Every volume now
  moves to the app's slot together with its index. This is what put files with a leading
  `!` in the mods folder.
- Deleting a cosmetic left the green "installed" badge on its catalog card until the next
  restart.
- Cosmetic pictures could go missing for a week: one refused request to the wiki was
  remembered as "no such picture". Only a real 404 counts now, and requests go out in small
  batches. Names the wiki spells its own way (`Mega-Kills: Axe`, apostrophes) are found too.

### Cosmetics work like the rest of the app

- Favorites and search show them, in a section of their own.
- Clicking one opens its page instead of installing it on the spot.
- The Library gives them a select-all, a count and a disable-all of their own, and the bulk
  bar takes them.

## 1.11.0

- Ctrl + wheel now looks at what the cursor is over: the title bar, the status bar and the
  category rail resize themselves, everything else scales the content.
- Every scale lives in Settings: one slider for all of it, plus a per-part block for the
  content and the three panels.
- The tab strip scrolls and swipes, so no tab is out of reach at a large scale.
- Packs export as a single .vpk file.
- Fixed: the panel grips did not drag at all, and scaling with the wheel shuddered.

## 1.10.0

- Set Dota's own text and voice language from the app.
- Mods follow the game's audio language folder after Dota's 2026-07-24 update, which stopped
  mounting made-up language folders.

## 1.9.1

- Fixed the Discord status icon and the master mods switch.

## 1.9.0

- Discord Rich Presence: your friends see the app while it is open.
- Privacy policy and terms pages.

## 1.8.1

- Sign-in moved to the title bar, and copying a preset link no longer opens a dialog.

## 1.8.0

- Share a preset as a `.d2mm` file or as a link, and sign in with Discord to put your name
  on the builds you share.
- Multi-volume imports fold into one VPK on the way in.
- Conflict detection stopped counting the filler assets every mod carries, so it only warns
  about real overlaps.
