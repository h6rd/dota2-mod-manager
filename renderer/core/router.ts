/* Which screen is showing, and how to get to another one.
 *
 * Screens have to be able to send the user elsewhere - a mod card jumps to the library, an
 * empty library points at the catalog - but if each screen imported the others, the graph
 * would be a knot and nothing could be extracted from app.js without dragging the rest
 * along. So screens do not know each other: each registers its render under a name, and
 * this is the only module that holds the map. Screens import the router, never the reverse.
 *
 * A screen is also built once and kept. Every switch used to rebuild the one being opened
 * from nothing: coming back to Heroes meant 513 cards and 6645 nodes again, and around 90ms
 * of frozen window each time, for a screen the user had been looking at a second earlier.
 * Each screen now owns an element that stays in the page, and switching shows it.
 *
 * What keeps a kept screen honest is the stale list. Anything that moves what screens read -
 * a mod installed or switched off, safe mode flipped, the whole window redrawn - says so
 * through invalidateViews(), and a switch to a screen on that list rebuilds it exactly as
 * before. Showing what is already built is only ever the answer when nothing has happened.
 *
 * Redrawing the screen you are already on never goes through the list: changing the sort or
 * opening a category concerns the catalog and nobody else, and those call their own render
 * directly, as they always did.
