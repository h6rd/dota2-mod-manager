/* Which note about Minify fits this machine, decided apart from the markup so it can be
 * tested without a window (test/minify-notice.test.ts). The words live in library/FolderBanners.tsx.
 *
 * src/minify.ts answers whose mods the game reads right now: 'ours', 'minify', 'both',
 * 'neither' or 'unknown'. 'neither' covers three different machines, and the banner used to
 * say the same sentence to all of them:
 *   - the game reads our folder, which simply holds none of our mods yet;
 *   - the game reads Minify's folder, which is empty;
 *   - the game reads a third folder, filled by nobody.
 * On the first, a fresh install next to Minify, it said "the game reads dota_russian and there
 * are no mods in it; ours are in dota_russian", which is both alarming and a contradiction.
 * And 'unknown' (the game's language not read yet) fell through to "the game reads our
 * folder", a guess the banner is not allowed to make.
