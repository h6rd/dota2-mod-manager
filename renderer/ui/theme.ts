/* Which hero the window is wearing.
 *
 * Eight palettes, the same eight the catalog's own site has, switched by clicking the mascot
 * in the title bar - h6rd let us bring both across (2026-08-01). The colours themselves live
 * in styles/themes.css; all this does is put the name on <html> and keep the picture in step.
 *
 * The mascots are animated GIFs from the catalog repository, listed there in GIF_CONFIG. We
 * fetch them the same way as every other picture in the app, so the first switch after a
 * fresh install needs the network and everything after it comes out of the cache.
