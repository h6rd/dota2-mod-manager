/* The one overlay every catalog window opens in: a mod's, a free look's, the item builder's.
 * One holds it at a time. Each says here how it lets go, and it lets go when another window takes
 * the overlay or once the overlay has closed.
 *
 * The window grows out of the card it was opened from (catalog/modal-motion.ts). Timings live in
 * modal.css; the only number needed here is when the exit is over, read rather than repeated so
 * the stylesheet stays the one place the tempo is set, and so the system's reduced-motion setting,
 * which flattens it to 1ms, is honoured for free. */
