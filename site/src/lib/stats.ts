/**
 * The numbers on the landing, counted at build time instead of typed in.
 *
 * They were typed in once, on 2026-08-07, and by 2026-08-10 all four had drifted: the page
 * claimed 1150 mods when the catalog held 1090, and 27 releases when there were 29. A page
 * whose trust section says the numbers are checkable cannot afford numbers that fail the
 * check, so now the build does the counting.
 *
 * Two sources. The catalog comes from the same mods.json the app reads, so the site and the
 * app can never disagree. Downloads and releases come from the GitHub API.
 *
 * On downloads, only the installer counts. Every release also carries latest.yml, which the
 * app fetches on every update check, and a .blockmap for differential updates: summing all
 * assets gives 70,022 where 19,227 people actually downloaded the thing. The inflated figure
 * is the more flattering one, which is exactly why it is not the one used.
 *
 * A static site's number is "as of the last build" no matter what, so the fallback below is
 * not a different kind of thing from a fetched one, only older. It is what an offline build
 * prints, and it is rounded down rather than up.
