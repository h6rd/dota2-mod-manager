/**
 * Seven more guides, in both languages.
 *
 * A separate file from docs.ts for length alone: the two together are one table of pages, and
 * merging happens there. The rule is the same one that file states - both languages side by
 * side, so a paragraph that exists in one and not the other is visible while typing.
 *
 * Why these seven. The five originals answer how modding works; these answer what people
 * actually type. Terrains are the most-wanted mod in Dota and every guide ranking for them
 * teaches the `-language tempcontent` trick that stopped producing a folder on 2026-07-24.
 * Removing mods is the second thing searched after installing them and nothing here answered
 * it. The language folder is the piece no other guide explains correctly, and it is the reason
 * the terrain guides broke. Announcers, and your own files, had no page at all. The last two
 * are about the people this is built on and about choosing between the tools in this corner:
 * both get asked, and until now both got answered by somebody else.
 *
 * Facts are read off the code they describe: pak slots and priority categories from
 * installer.js (PRIORITY_CATEGORIES, allocatePak), the folder name from gamelang.js, the
 * search-path patch from patcher.js. Claims about other people's software are limited to what
 * their own site or repository states, and said as theirs.
 *
 * Counts written as {mods} or {categories} are filled by the layout at build time.
