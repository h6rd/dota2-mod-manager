/* Being uninstalled.
 *
 * Removing the app used to leave everything it had done: the mods still in the game's language
 * folder with nothing left to manage them, the app's folder with its settings, caches and the
 * fifty-megabyte toolchain, and - if safe mode had been turned off -
 * gameinfo_branchspecific.gi and dota.signatures still carrying our edit, with the one program
 * that knows how to put them back now gone.
 *
 * The uninstaller therefore runs the app one last time (see build/installer.nsh) and this is
 * what it runs: a window that asks what to take with it, and the work itself. Everything here
 * goes through the same code the app uses day to day rather than deleting paths by hand, so a
 * mod comes out the way removing it from the Library would, and the patch comes out the way
 * the safe-mode switch would.
 *
 * Exit codes are the answer to the uninstaller: 3 means the person changed their mind and
 * nothing should be removed at all, anything else means carry on. 4 additionally means the
 * app's own folder goes with the program.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in src/main.ts because it is a whole second application - its own
 * window, its own preload, its own five IPC channels, its own exit protocol - that shares
 * nothing with the app except the services it borrows to do the removing.
