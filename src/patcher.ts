// Search-path patch: registers an extra content folder ahead of the game's own, which
// is the only way to override files the engine reads through the MOD path id -
// scripts/items/items_game.txt above all. Mods in a language folder can replace any
// ordinary asset, but never the item schema: MOD resolves to game/dota alone.
//
// Mechanics (same shape the community patchers use, rebuilt from the local files):
//   game/dota/gameinfo_branchspecific.gi  gets a FileSystem/SearchPaths block whose
//     content is derived from the CURRENT gameinfo.gi plus our folder, so a Valve
//     change to the search paths is carried over instead of silently dropped;
//   game/bin/win64/dota.signatures        gets a line with the patched file's SHA1+CRC,
//     because the client checks that file against the signature list.
//
// Everything is backed up before the first write and revert() puts the originals back.
