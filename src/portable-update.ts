/* Updating a copy that was never installed.
 *
 * electron-updater updates Windows by handing the download to the NSIS installer, and a
 * portable build has none, so it sits at whatever version it was downloaded at. The obvious
 * fix is to have the exe replace itself: rename the running file, drop the new one in its
 * place, restart. It works, and it is also exactly the shape of behaviour that antivirus
 * heuristics are built to notice - an unsigned executable rewriting and relaunching itself.
 * This project has already been through one Defender false positive without doing anything of
 * the sort, and a portable build is the one people pick specifically to keep their system
 * untouched.
 *
 * So the new version is downloaded and put NEXT TO the current exe, and the user is told it is
 * there. One double click instead of a trip to the website, and nothing on disk is rewritten.
 *
 * What makes it safe to download at all: CI publishes portable.yml beside the installer, with
 * the size and SHA-256 of that release's portable exe. The manifest is fetched from GitHub
 * itself with no mirrors in the way (a mirror could rewrite both the hash and the file), and
 * the download is then checked against it. A file that does not match is deleted rather than
 * offered.
