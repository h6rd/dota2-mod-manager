// Noticing that Dota was patched, while the app is open.
//
// A game update overwrites the search-path patch and moves the item table underneath the
// built schema, and the repair for that already exists (schemaService.heal). What was
// missing is the moment to run it: until now the app only looked at startup and when its
// own Play button was pressed. Steam updates the game in the background, and most people
// press Play in Steam. So the app sat there, open, next to a game whose mods had stopped
// working, and said nothing.
//
// Two files tell the whole story and both are Valve's:
//   dota/steam.inf         ClientVersion, bumped by every patch;
//   bin/win64/dota.signatures  the signature list, rewritten by a patch and put back by
//                          Steam's file check.
// The signature digest is taken with our own appended line stripped, so applying our patch
// never looks like a game update - otherwise the app would keep waking itself up.
// Two more questions are asked at the same build, because the stamp cannot see them: has
// Steam's file check taken the search path out, and was it built from a gameinfo.gi the game
// has since replaced.
//
// This module only decides "the game changed"; what to do about it lives in src/game-upkeep.ts.
