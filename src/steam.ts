 * and the leftovers of a move have neither. The executable has a different name and a
 * different folder on Linux, and src/patcher.ts already knows both.
 *
 * Two markers rather than one because a single file can be absent from a real install for a
 * moment - mid-download, or while Steam verifies. Note which pak this is: game\dota\pak01_dir
 * is the game's own content and is always there. The pak01 files in game\dota_<language> are
