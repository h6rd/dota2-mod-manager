/**
 * Which installed mods a Dota update reached.
 *
 * A mod replaces some of Valve's files with its own copies. When an update changes one of those
 * files, the mod keeps serving the copy it was built from, and the game gets the old version back
 * on top of the new one. Most of the time nothing shows; sometimes a HUD loses a new element or a
 * versus screen breaks. Build 6946 (2026-10-07) changed 221 HUD layouts, and a HUD mod in daily
 * use replaced 15 of them. Nothing told its owner which mod to look at.
 *
 * The game's pak01 index says what each of Valve's files is (path and CRC), but only for the build
 * on disk: the build before is gone the moment Steam writes the new one. So this keeps a note of
 * Valve's CRC for every path an installed mod replaces, taken while the game is unchanged, and
 * after an update compares the note with the new index. That is thousands of paths, not the
 * 388 000 in the index, and the index is read only when the game or the set of paths changed.
 *
 * A mod stays marked until its own file changes (an update of the mod, a reinstall) or it is
 * removed: an older patch does not make a stale copy fresh again.
