/* What a VPK has to go through before it counts as a mod.
 *
 * A file that just landed in the game folder is not yet a mod: it has no name anybody would
 * recognise, it may carry the whole game's item table, and it may hold four heroes in one
 * archive. Everything here is the difference between a row saying "pak42" and a row saying
 * what the thing actually is.
 *
 * Every route into the library comes through this: the import button, drag and drop, and the
 * mods that arrive inside a shared preset. That last one used to land as a bare record
 * instead, which is why a received build showed up unnamed, unrecognised and still needing
 * "split" by hand, while the same file dragged in by the user came out clean. One door, so
 * that cannot happen again.
 *
 * Lifted out of main.js unchanged, with the services arriving as arguments the way
 * src/cursors.ts and src/presets-service.ts take them. It moved for the same reason the
 * cursors did: main.js cannot be required by a test, so none of this could be tested where it
 * was, and it decides what a user sees in their library.
