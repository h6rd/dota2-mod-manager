/* The beta channel: who is let in, and which update feed this copy reads.
 *
 * Staged rollout was dropped in September 2026 for a good reason: an urgent fix has to reach
 * everybody at once, and two versions in the wild at the same time make a Discord thread
 * impossible to follow. A beta channel is the other half of that argument. It is not a slice of
 * everybody, it is a few people the maintainer picked himself, who know they are running the
 * build that has not been released yet.
 *
 * Who: the accounts already signed in with Discord (src/discord-auth.ts). The list lives in the
 * signed config/app.json, so it changes without a release, and it holds hashes rather than ids -
 * that file is public, and a list of a dozen people's Discord accounts is not ours to publish.
 * The salt sits next to the list: it does not make a hash unguessable for somebody who already
 * has a specific id in mind, and it does stop the file being a ready-made list to look up.
 *
 * What it is not: a lock. Nothing here is checked by a server, the build itself is a public
 * prerelease on GitHub, and a determined person can download it whatever this says. The gate
 * decides who is offered the beta, not who is able to run it. If that ever needs to be a real
 * lock, the files have to move behind something that verifies a Discord token, and that is a
 * different piece of work.
 *
 * Signing out of Discord takes the beta with it: without an id there is nobody to check against,
 * so the channel falls back to the stable one on the next check.
