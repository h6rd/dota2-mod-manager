/**
 * An arcana as a mod, built from the game's own files: the look of an item a player has not got,
 * in a colour they choose, in safe mode (issue #118, starting with Terrorblade).
 *
 * In the game the arcana is an item: the hero's model is swapped for the arcana's, the item creates
 * its own particles, and a gem tints the rest (src/recolor.ts). A mod cannot give an item, so it
 * puts the arcana's files where the plain hero's are:
 * - the arcana's models under the names of the hero's own, each named inside for the path it now
 *   has; the hero's model also told to play its arcana animations, which in the game the item
 *   turns on as the activity modifier "abysm" (issue #118: without it, an attack played the
 *   injured one);
 * - a particle the hero already creates, taken from the arcana's version and given the arcana's
 *   own particles as children, since nothing else would create them; the children are named in
 *   the file's RERL block too, as the compiler names them. A child is drawn at the control points
 *   its parent hands it, so a new one gets a point of its own on the attachment it needs (the
 *   glow of the body on the chest, where the eyes would put it at the right eye);
 * - the arcana's portraits and ability icons under the plain ones' names;
 * - no gem, so its tint is off: the colour is written into the particles and materials instead
 *   (`bake`). Built once from Valve's files and kept in the mod, it is the same after a patch only
 *   until the files it was built from change, so the app builds it again then.
 * Not here: the kill effect (a modifier the item adds), the arcana's sounds and voice lines.
