/* Where an installed copy looks for a new version, and on which channel.
 *
 * Moved out of main.js on 2026-09-19, unchanged in what it does, so the beta channel had
 * somewhere to live and so this could be tested against a stand-in for electron-updater rather
 * than only by releasing something.
 *
 * Two feeds. GitHub is the origin; https://cdn.dota2modmanager.com/updates/ is a copy this
 * project also owns, tried only after GitHub fails. On 2026-08-17 GitHub was down for three
 * hours, which meant no installed copy could check for or fetch an update, and nobody noticed,
 * because an app that fails to update looks exactly like an app. Each four-hourly round starts at
 * GitHub again: the mirror is for the hours it is down, not a place to settle into.
 *
 * Two channels. Everybody reads `latest`; the testers the maintainer picked read `beta`, which is
 * a different manifest (beta.yml) in the same place. src/beta.ts decides who is on which, and the
 * decision is re-read rather than remembered: a tester taken off the list is back on the stable
 * channel at the next check, without anybody touching their machine.
 *
 * A portable copy cannot replace itself: electron-updater installs by handing the download to the
 * NSIS installer, and a portable build has none, so it would download 100 MB and then fail
 * quietly. It still looks, and says where the new copy lives.
