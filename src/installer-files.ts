 * Minify marks its work by packing metadata into the VPKs it builds, and checks for that
 * before deleting one. The same courtesy in the other direction cannot be done the same way:
 * mods from the catalog are copied byte for byte and identified by a hash of their contents,
 * and the project is building integrity guarantees on the file being exactly what the catalog
 * published - sha256 on download, a signed catalog after that. Repacking every install to
 * insert a marker is cheap enough (35ms against 15ms for a plain copy of a 46 MB mod, and the
 * hash survives if marker names are left out of it), but it would end byte-identity, which is
 * worth more than the convenience.
 *
 * So the marker is one file beside the mods instead of a marker inside each one. Anything
 * reading it learns which files in the folder belong to this app, which is the question a
 * second mod manager actually needs answered before it deletes anything.
