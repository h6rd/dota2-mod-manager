/* The load order in two parts.
 *
 * The game mounts pakNN_dir.vpk in numeric order and the first copy of a file wins, so a mod's
 * slot number is its priority. Some categories have to load before everything else: trees,
 * river, shaders, hero effects and a few more replace files other mods ship too, and lose
 * otherwise. Slots 02-29 belong to them; every other mod starts at 30.
 *
 * Since 2026-09-24. Until then only the first install kept the two apart: a mod
 * moved up past a shader took the shader's slot, and a shader imported by hand and then linked
 * to the catalog stayed wherever the import had put it. 28 slots rather than the old eight
 * because those categories hold 217 catalog mods between them, 126 of them hero items, and eight
 * ran out after one shader, one set of trees, one river and a few items.
 *
 * The installer hands out slots through freeSlotIn; moving a mod between the two parts, and the
 * one-time layout of an order from before, live here too so the rules sit in one place.
