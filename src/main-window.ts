/* The one window the app has: its size on the screen it opens on, the single page it may show,

 *
 * The window shows one page and never another. A preload script is attached to the webContents,
 * not to the document, so a page the window navigated to would inherit window.api: the whole IPC
 * surface, install and runTool included. Nothing in the app navigates anywhere, but the catalog's
 * own HTML lands in the interface (guides), and one <meta http-equiv="refresh"> in it would be
 * enough to hand that surface to whoever wrote the markup. CSP does not cover navigation, so this
 * does: the app's own file is the only thing the window may load, and a link that wants a browser
 * gets the browser.

 * places it anyway and the bottom of it sits under the taskbar or past the edge of the screen,
 * where the launch bar and the last rows of a list are. Nothing is broken and nothing scrolls
 * wrong; the part of the window holding them is simply not on the screen, which reads exactly
 * like a page that stops scrolling partway. A restart does not help, because the size is asked
 * for again every time.
 *
 * Display scaling makes it worse rather than better: at 150% a 1080p screen reports a work area
 * around 1280x680, so a machine whose specification looks roomy has less room than the laptop.
 *
 * The minimums are clamped too. A minimum taller than the screen is not a floor, it is a
 * guarantee of the same overflow, and it takes away the one thing the person can do about it.
