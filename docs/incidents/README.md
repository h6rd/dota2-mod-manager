# Incidents

What broke for players, or came close, and what now stops it from happening again. One file per
incident, named by the day it was found.

## Writing one

Copy the shape of any file above: a title, a table with `Date`, `Versions`, `Fixed in` and
`Impact` (add `Issue` with the issue number when there is one), then four sections in this order.

1. **What happened**, as a player or a maintainer saw it.
2. **Why**, in a sentence or two.
3. **Why nothing caught it**: each check that existed and what it missed.
4. **What catches it now**: one bullet per guard, starting with the path in backticks. When the
   guard is one test or one workflow step, give its title in double quotes after the path.

`test/incidents.test.js` holds every file here to the repository as it is. A path that no longer
exists, a quoted test title that no test carries any more, or a file missing from the table above
fails the suite. Deleting a guard means editing its incident in the same change, and saying what
replaced it.

An issue labelled `regression` gets a file here. The radar lists a closed one that no file names
in its `Issue` row.
